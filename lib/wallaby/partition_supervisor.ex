  defmodule PartitionSupervisor do
    @moduledoc """
    A supervisor that starts multiple partitions of the same child.

    Certain processes may become bottlenecks in large systems.
    If those processes can have their state trivially partitioned,
    in a way there is no dependency between them, then they can use
    the `PartitionSupervisor` to create multiple isolated and
    independent partitions.

    Once the `PartitionSupervisor` starts, you can dispatch to its
    children using `{:via, PartitionSupervisor, {name, key}}`, where
    `name` is the name of the `PartitionSupervisor` and key is used
    for routing.

    ## Example

    The `DynamicSupervisor` is a single process responsible for starting
    other processes. In some applications, the `DynamicSupervisor` may
    become a bottleneck. To address this, you can start multiple instances
    of the `DynamicSupervisor` through a `PartitionSupervisor`, and then
    pick a "random" instance to start the child on.

    Instead of starting a single `DynamicSupervisor`:

        children = [
          {DynamicSupervisor, name: MyApp.DynamicSupervisor}
        ]

        Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)

    and starting children on that dynamic supervisor directly:

        DynamicSupervisor.start_child(MyApp.DynamicSupervisor, {Agent, fn -> %{} end})

    You can do start the dynamic supervisors under a `PartitionSupervisor`:

        children = [
          {PartitionSupervisor,
           child_spec: DynamicSupervisor,
           name: MyApp.DynamicSupervisors}
        ]

        Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)

    and then:

        DynamicSupervisor.start_child(
          {:via, PartitionSupervisor, {MyApp.DynamicSupervisors, self()}},
          {Agent, fn -> %{} end}
        )

    In the code above, we start a partition supervisor that will by default
    start a dynamic supervisor for each core in your machine. Then, instead
    of calling the `DynamicSupervisor` by name, you call it through the
    partition supervisor using the `{:via, PartitionSupervisor, {name, key}}`
    format. We picked `self()` as the routing key, which means each process
    will be assigned one of the existing dynamic supervisors. See `start_link/1`
    to see all options supported by the `PartitionSupervisor`.

    ## Implementation notes

    The `PartitionSupervisor` uses either an ETS table or a `Registry` to
    manage all of the partitions. Under the hood, the `PartitionSupervisor`
    generates a child spec for each partition and then acts as a regular
    supervisor. The ID of each child spec is the partition number.

    For routing, two strategies are used. If `key` is an integer, it is routed
    using `rem(abs(key), partitions)` where `partitions` is the number of
    partitions. Otherwise it uses `:erlang.phash2(key, partitions)`.
    The particular routing may change in the future, and therefore must not
    be relied on. If you want to retrieve a particular PID for a certain key,
    you can use `GenServer.whereis({:via, PartitionSupervisor, {name, key}})`.

    Starts a partition supervisor with the given options.

    This function is typically not invoked directly, instead it is invoked
    when using a `PartitionSupervisor` as a child of another supervisor:

        children = [
          {PartitionSupervisor, child_spec: SomeChild, name: MyPartitionSupervisor}
        ]

    If the supervisor is successfully spawned, this function returns
    `{:ok, pid}`, where `pid` is the PID of the supervisor. If the given name
    for the partition supervisor is already assigned to a process,
    the function returns `{:error, {:already_started, pid}}`, where `pid`
    is the PID of that process.

    Note that a supervisor started with this function is linked to the parent
    process and exits not only on crashes but also if the parent process exits
    with `:normal` reason.

    ## Options

      * `:name` - an atom or via tuple representing the name of the partition
        supervisor (see `t:name/0`).

      * `:partitions` - a positive integer with the number of partitions.
        Defaults to `System.schedulers_online()` (typically the number of cores).

      * `:strategy` - the restart strategy option, defaults to `:one_for_one`.
        You can learn more about strategies in the `Supervisor` module docs.

      * `:max_restarts` - the maximum number of restarts allowed in
        a time frame. Defaults to `3`.

      * `:max_seconds` - the time frame in which `:max_restarts` applies.
        Defaults to `5`.

      * `:with_arguments` - a two-argument anonymous function that allows
        the partition to be given to the child starting function. See the
        `:with_arguments` section below.

    ## `:with_arguments`

    Sometimes you want each partition to know their partition assigned number.
    This can be done with the `:with_arguments` option. This function receives
    the list of arguments of the child specification and the partition. It
    must return a new list of arguments that will be passed to the child specification
    of children.

    For example, most processes are started by calling `start_link(opts)`,
    where `opts` is a keyword list. You could inject the partition into the
    options given to the child:

        with_arguments: fn [opts], partition ->
          [Keyword.put(opts, :partition, partition)]
        end
